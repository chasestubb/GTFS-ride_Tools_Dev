### Rogue Valley + Josephine
Rogue Valley Commuter Line (ID: 225) + Josephine Community Transit (ID: 94)

Data appears to have been gathered 2017-2018. This test feed was used by Ben Fields and has been re-used by the 2019-2020 OSU Capstone team.

Many fields are empty, including some important ones, such as alightings (getting off the train/etc) and times (only dates are included). This is because the data is real-world data and the methods of data collection for these two agencies were likely less technologically advanced.

### Specification Example Feed

### Simple Specification Example Feed
